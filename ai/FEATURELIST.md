Text Expander Feature Implementation Checklist
This checklist is organized into modules to guide you through the development of a comprehensive text expansion service.

1. Basic Text Expansion Core
Snippet Creation & Storage

[ ] Design a data model for snippets with fields for ID, abbreviation, content, type, and creation/modification timestamps.

[ ] Create a user interface for entering and saving new snippets, including a text area, abbreviation field, and content type selector.

[ ] Implement a database or file-based storage system (e.g., SQLite, JSON file) to persist snippet data.

[ ] Integrate a rich text editor library to support formatted text (bold, italic, links, lists).

[ ] Ensure the system can handle all Unicode characters and a wide range of emojis.

Expansion Engine

[ ] Implement a global keyboard hook using platform-specific APIs to capture keystrokes across all applications.

[ ] Develop a state machine to track typed characters and identify when a full abbreviation has been completed.

[ ] Implement logic to automatically delete the typed abbreviation and programmatically paste the snippet's content.

[ ] Create a conflict resolution mechanism (e.g., a pop-up selection menu) to handle multiple snippets with the same abbreviation.

Editing & Deletion

[ ] Create a main UI that displays a searchable, filterable list of all existing snippets.

[ ] Implement a function to select a snippet from the list and load its data into the editor for modification.

[ ] Add a confirmation dialog before permanently deleting a snippet to prevent accidental data loss.

Autocorrect & Typos

[ ] Pre-populate a list of common typos and their correct spellings.

[ ] Create a user interface for adding, editing, and removing custom autocorrect pairs.

[ ] Implement a toggle to enable or disable the autocorrect feature per snippet or globally.

2. Dynamic & Interactive Features
Dynamic Placeholders

[ ] Implement a parser for date placeholders (e.g., {date:yyyy-MM-dd}).

[ ] Implement a parser for time placeholders (e.g., {time:hh:mm:ss}).

[ ] Develop a function to retrieve and insert the current content of the system clipboard.

Date & Time Manipulation

[ ] Create a parser for date arithmetic expressions (e.g., {date+2w} for two weeks from now).

[ ] Implement logic to handle different units of time (days, weeks, months, years) and complex expressions.

Fill-in Forms

[ ] Design a modal or pop-up interface that renders a form when a snippet with fields is triggered.

[ ] Implement a syntax for defining simple text input fields (e.g., {{text:label}}).

[ ] Add a mechanism for creating drop-down menus with user-defined options (e.g., {{menu:options=Option1,Option2}}).

[ ] Implement a syntax for defining optional content blocks that can be toggled via a checkbox.

Advanced Logic

[ ] Build a simple parser and evaluator for basic mathematical expressions.

[ ] Develop a secure, sandboxed environment to execute JavaScript or other scripts from within a snippet.

[ ] Implement a placeholder tag ({cursor}) that is automatically removed after expansion, leaving the cursor in its place.

Variable Management

[ ] Create a dedicated settings section for defining global user variables (e.g., {my_full_name}).

[ ] Implement a system to parse and replace these variables within any snippet.

3. Organization & Management
Snippet Organization

[ ] Create a hierarchical tree-view structure for organizing snippets into groups and folders.

[ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to easily reorganize snippets.

[ ] Add sorting functions to order snippets by name, date modified, or usage count.

Search Functionality

[ ] Implement a real-time, fuzzy-search algorithm to quickly find snippets by abbreviation, title, or content.

[ ] Assign a configurable hotkey to launch a floating search window.

Import/Export

[ ] Implement parsers for common text expander formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) to import existing snippets.

[ ] Develop a function to serialize snippet data into a supported export format for backups.

System Preferences

[ ] Create a settings menu to manage application-specific expansion rules.

[ ] Implement a toggle for global case-sensitivity.

[ ] Allow users to assign and modify hotkeys for different program actions.

4. Collaboration & Sync
Device Syncing

[ ] Integrate with popular cloud service APIs (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) for data storage.

[ ] Implement a background sync process to automatically keep local data consistent across devices.

Team Sharing

[ ] Create a feature to invite other users to a shared group.

[ ] Implement an access control list (ACL) to manage read/write permissions for shared snippets.

[ ] Develop an admin dashboard for team-wide management of snippets and users.

5. Additional Features
AI Integration

[ ] Set up API calls to a large language model to provide AI-powered text generation based on prompts.

[ ] Integrate an AI service for grammar, tone, and spelling checks.

Clipboard Manager

[ ] Create a history of the last 10-20 items copied to the clipboard.

[ ] Implement a hotkey or menu to bring up the clipboard history for selection.

Advanced Automation

[ ] Develop a secure, sandboxed environment for executing shell scripts.

[ ] Design a command-line tool for headless management of snippets.

Output & Documentation

[ ] Implement a PDF export library to generate a printable document of all snippets.

User Interface

[ ] Follow modern UI/UX principles to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive design.



# Variable Types
Input Fields & Variables

[ ] Text Variables: For inserting text strings like names, topics, or stock tickers.

[ ] Custom Variables: User-defined variables that can be used and reused across snippets.

[ ] Numerical Variables: For defining quantities, ranges, or time horizons (e.g., word count, number of days).

[ ] Document Variables: For injecting large blocks of text or entire documents for analysis.

Selection & Control

[ ] Drop-down Menus: To select a single predefined option from a list (e.g., tone, output format, model selection).

[ ] Checkboxes: To include or exclude specific sections, instructions, or features.

[ ] Multi-select Lists: To choose multiple predefined options (e.g., a list of technical indicators).

[ ] Boolean Toggles: A simple true/false switch to enable or disable a specific feature or constraint.

Dynamic & Automated Content

[ ] Dynamic Placeholders: Automatically insert real-time data like dates, times, and clipboard content.

[ ] Date and Time Arithmetic: To calculate and insert dates in the past or future.

[ ] Mathematical Expressions: To perform simple calculations within a snippet.

[ ] Executable Scripts: To run JavaScript or other scripts for advanced automation.

Specialized Variables

[ ] Instructional Variables: For swapping in different AI commands (e.g., "summarize," "critique").

[ ] Timeframe Variables: To define a specific date range (e.g., start and end dates) for data analysis.

[ ] Filtering Criteria: A combination of variables to screen and filter data based on specific criteria.


# Extension Components
Popup: This is a very common UI component, as it provides a quick and easy way for users to interact with an extension.

Content Scripts: Many extensions need to interact with the web pages the user is visiting, making content scripts a frequent integration.

Background Scripts: These are essential for many extensions to handle events and maintain state, even when no other UI is visible.

Options Page: Most extensions that require user configuration will have an options page.

Badges: This is a simple and effective way to provide visual feedback, so it's used frequently.

Context Menus: Useful for adding functionality to a right-click menu, but not all extensions need this.

Omnibox: This is less common, as it's typically used by extensions that provide a search or command-line-like interface.

New Tab Page: This is a more specialized component, used by extensions that aim to change the new tab experience.

Notifications: Used by extensions that need to alert the user to something, but not a core part of every extension.

DevTools Panel: This is a niche component, primarily used by extensions for developers.

Side Panel: A newer and more specialized UI element.

Commands: Keyboard shortcuts are a feature that many extensions offer but aren't the primary mode of interaction.

Themes: This is the most specialized UI component, as its sole purpose is to change the browser's appearance.
